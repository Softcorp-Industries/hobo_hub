# The HOBO HUB - Calgary, AB Canada

This is a simple site to provide some quick links to community resourses.

The HOBO HUB is a simple set-up of 6 seperate Blog pages. They're used like a bulletin board with posts attached to the board, with some modern technology added to hyper-link, phone, email or whatever the service provides for contact. The basic fundamental purpose of the HUB is to get people connected to the resources not to keep them on the page.

I believe this can be used for anyone wishing to connect groups looking for common answers. Sporting communities, Social communities or anything you can think of. It can be a handy tool for quick reference and direction.

I used 11ty to build the static pages, I gave it a little style and kept the template model in mind for a uniform look.

Thank you for your interest in the HOBO HUB.
