# The HOBO HUB - Calgary, AB Canada

This is a simple site to provide some quick links to community resourses.

The HOBO HUB is a simple set-up of 6 seperate Blog pages. They're used like a bulletin board with posts attached to the board. I added some modern technology to hyper-link, phone, email or whatever the service provides for contact info. The basic fundamental purpose of the HUB is to get people connected to the resources they need not to keep them on the page.

I believe this can be used for anyone wishing to connect groups looking for common answers. Sporting communities, Social communities or anything you can think of. It can be a handy tool for quick reference and direction.

For the HOBO HUB I seperated the pages into 6 different categories. Food, Clothing, Shelter, Employment, Health and Legal. I have experience all of these challenges in my life living in a homeless shelter. My answer to my homeless problem was to learn Web Development, I hope this shows some progress in that journey. One of the principals of coding that learned was to take a problem and find a solution.

This is my solution to a problem I found when I had to live in homeless shelters. There are plenty of people and organizations willing to help you. Do you know the names of the organization's? Do you know where they are? I did pay attention when I learned that if the meta doesn't reflect what services you give for the search then it doesn't show up. Hopefully they have the correct search criteria but if they don't, hopefully the hub can narrow that search and give a quick link the services needed.

"I don't know, Check the HUB"

I used 11ty to build the static pages and gave it a little style. The template model makes for a nice uniform look and the use of the front matter with 11ty gives it a dynamic feel.

Any idea's for improvement would be greatly appreciated. Any contributions that you can help with, like some middleware and a backend to connect the HUBS world wide would be awesome too. It's GNU open souce and should be available for free everywhere. My skill level is not there yet, it will be but I don't want to stand in the way either.

Build a HUB for your community.

Thank you for your interest in the HOBO HUB.
