<blockquote>
The Calgary John Howard Society (CJHS) is a charity that has been reducing crime and making Calgary communities safer since 1949 by helping youth and adults make positive changes and move away from criminal behaviour.

We address the root causes of crime by providing education, employment programs, housing and support so they have alternatives to breaking the law.

Justice is best served through measures that resolve conflict, embrace diversity and repair harm, while holding the individual accountable for their actions. We believe in understanding the context of why a crime was committed or harm was caused. Our goal is to restore relationships and support people in order to prevent future harm, making the Calgary community safer for all.

CJHS offers unique programs for youth and adults from all walks of life, most of whom have experienced trauma that has contributed to their involvement in the justice system. We work to remove the barriers to housing, education and employment that these individuals face, so they can make positive changes and move forward with their lives.
