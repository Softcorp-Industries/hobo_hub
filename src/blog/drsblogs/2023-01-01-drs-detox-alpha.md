<p class="subHeader">Transitional Housing</p>

Alpha House provides 12 transitional beds in its detox facility to individuals who have completed their detox program and are awaiting start dates for drug-treatment or housing programs. Detox is a requirement for many rehabilitation facilities, but wait times for bed availability can be substantial. Our transitional beds provide a safe environment for clients to assist them in achieving their goal of entering a rehab program.

<br>

Individuals wishing to enter into either the Detoxification or Transitional Bed Program can call <a href="tel:403-234-7388"> 403-234-7388</a> Ext #2 to inquire about bed space or arrive at 203 15 Ave SE and ask to be assessed for the Detox Program.

<br>

<em>A person must complete a detox program before they can be considered for a Transitional Bed.
