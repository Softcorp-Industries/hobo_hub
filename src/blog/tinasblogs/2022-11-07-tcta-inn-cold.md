"Helping families overcome obstacles that can lead to a cycle of homelessness — that’s what we strive to do with every family that asks Inn from the Cold for help!

Are you a family in the Calgary area currently experiencing a housing crisis? We are here to help you! We provide three main programs to help families: homelessness prevention and diversion, emergency family shelter, and supportive housing. We accept any family with a pregnant mother or at least one child under 18 years of age."
