The Kerby Shelter is a safe place for men and women 55+ who are experiencing elder abuse.

Elder abuse may present as physical abuse, emotional abuse, financial abuse, sexual abuse, verbal abuse or neglect, usually occurring within a relationship where there is an expectation of trust. The abuse can result in distress, serious harm or even homelessness to the older adult in some situations.

If you have been experiencing elder abuse, we can help you regain your confidence, sense of peace and place in the community. In addition to various programs and amenities, we provide individualized case management support to help you re-establish yourself in the community.
