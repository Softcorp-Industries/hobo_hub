<blockquote>
Incarcerated Canadian women are most often jailed for property offences, which are often considered to be a crime of poverty (Statistics Canada, 2017). However, the introduction of Bill 9 has reduced the negative impacts of poverty-related charges as warrants can no longer be issued for those who do not address their charges.
