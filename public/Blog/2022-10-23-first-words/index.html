<p>I guess we should start with an introduction, my name is ... you never knew me before so my name isn't important now, you can just refer to me as Freight Train Freddie.</p>
<p>I dissappeared from society many years ago, why I'm writing a blog now is just as baffling to me as it is to you. We haven't talked or understood each other for a long time now.</p>
<p>These are my words to you...</p>
